# Competetive Programming using C++

This repository comprises of questions asked in competetive programming by many companies in their hiring rounds as well as in CP competitions.

I have attempted these questions in C++ language as it is one of the fastest languages out there. It is to be noted that the logic for any problem remains the same and programming language holds no barrier while attempting these questions. While attempting the questions I have also tried to keep the code readable and understandable by a novice coder.

Feel free to contribute to my repository by adding codes for the given questions in various other programming language or refining / suggest a better code.
